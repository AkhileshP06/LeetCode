# LeetCode

This repository contains compilation of my solutions for various LeetCode questions. I use LeetCode as a platform to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and I document my solutions here for reference.

Structure

Each question is organized into its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find a README file containing the problem description.You will also find the solution for that problem in either java or python inside that directory.

Commit Messages

I used a chrome extension called "LeetHub" which automatically pushes accepted solution in github to a linked github repository. I highly reccomend using it. It also create custom commit messages for each solution based on the solve statistics (time and space compexities and how they compare to other solutions on leetcode).

Contributions

Contributions and feedback are welcome! If you find a better or more efficient solution, feel free to open a pull request or create an issue to discuss it further.
